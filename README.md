Write up a description of the game, rules and how to play in here. 
@channel YOUR PROJECT IS NOT CONSIDERED COMPLETE UNTIL YOU HAVE CREATE A README.md (in the top-level folder)
Your README.md should include:
• a link to the live playable game on GitHub (see the GitHub Pages setup instructions for how to get your live link; it will look something like https://your-github-username.github.io/your-repo-name ...share it with family and friends ...think of them as free beta testers/QA )
• a general description of the project
• screenshot is nice to have
• description of main features and any instructions on how to use them
• list of any known bugs
• tech used (JS, HTML, CSS, jQuery)
• anything else you want to record about the project or the experience
• a wishlist of any leftover features you'd like to add later
Check out this guide to writing a file in Markdown (.md) format, it's easy
You can even turn on a Markdown Preview mode from a .md file you're editing in VS Code with the shortcut cmd + shift + v  (or search for "markdown" in the Command Palette) - use split panel mode to see both the source file and the preview on the same screen and try out the markdown syntax interactively  :zap: (edited) winningMessage( pos0 );
