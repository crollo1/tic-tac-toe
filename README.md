Bugs
The only current bug is within the media query - the 'Choose your player text' displays incorrectly. This has not been solved due to time constraints.

â€¢ tech used (JS, HTML, CSS - included media queries, jQuery)????

Next steps would be to add an A.I. feature to play against the computer, a score keeper function and a mouse hover feature. Improving the media query would also be a goal.
